# Cupcake Defender

This will be a simple shooting game.  10 levels with unique backgrounds.
The gameplay engine is basically built.

Next steps are:

-level transition: have gameplay stop and show a storyline screen, then start with a new level

-use all png graphics in place of vector-coded graphics :'(

-add hit detection so player will need to avoid falling objects

-make more enemy object-types

-touch controls that turn on if the screen is tapped
